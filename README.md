# D2RMM-Mod-Creator

This tool creates a D2RMM-compatible mod from multiple .txt files. Here's how it works:

1. Place your source files (e.g., "cubemain.txt", "itemstatcost.txt", "properties.txt") in the same folder as "convert_modfiles.exe".
2. Run "convert_modfiles.exe".
3. The tool generates two files: "mod.js" and "mod.json".
4. These output files will recreate your source files exactly when used with D2RMM.

**Key Benefits:**
- Allows integration with other D2RMM mods
- Works with open-source mods only
- Supports .txt files, not binary (.bin) files

**Important Considerations:**
- The tool may not work correctly if your source files are corrupted or contain unusual characters.
- For added peace of mind, you may want to scan "convert_modfiles.exe" with a virus scanner before use.
- The source code for this tool is also attached for transparency and review.

**Note:** This tool is designed for use with D2RMM (Diablo 2 Resurrected Mod Manager).
